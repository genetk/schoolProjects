1. Guests browse the medications by the first letter. Display all the alphabet letters, when a letter is clicked all medications starting with the letter are fetched and displayed. All guests can read the reviews. 
2. Guests will need to signup and signin before they can add medications or reviews.
3. Users may add medications. Only the medication owner may update or delete their medication.
4. Users may submit reviews. Only the review owner may update or delete their reviews.
  
### Application specifications and requirements
 project  uses the following:  
* Implement a login-based system with JWT.  
* Browsing medications and reading reviews is open to guests, but adding, updating, and deleting functionality is restricted to logged-in users.
* State properties in all components and services should be declared as a `signal`.
* Implemented proper lazy-loading techniques for the user-protected components.
